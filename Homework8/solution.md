## Polynomial practice
$`p(x) = x^3 − 5x^2 − 4x + 20`$
1. There are three roots: -2, 2, and 5
2. $`(x + 2)(x^2 − 7x + 10)`$
3. p(x) has the third degree and q(x) has the second

## Notes on the podcast
It was awesome! Thank you, Ariel Gabizon.

I didn't understand some of the concepts, but the discussion gave a great deal of intuition on the history of SNARKs and where we are right now (or half a year ago, at least).

It was interesting to listen to detailed explanations of homomorphism (additive and multiplicative) and how it can be used to boost proving time.
