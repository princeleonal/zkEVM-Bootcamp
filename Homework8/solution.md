## Notes on the podcast
It was awesome! Thank you, Ariel Gabizon.

I didn't understand some of the concepts, but the discussion gave a great deal of intuition on the history of SNARKs and where we are right now (or half a year ago, at least).

It was interesting to listen to detailed explanations of homomorphism (additive and multiplicative) and how it can be used to boost proving time.
