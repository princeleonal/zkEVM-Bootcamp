## What we have discussed in the team
L2s that you have experience with:
- Polygon zkEVM
- Optimism -> Kwenta ( has lower fees ;) )
- Arbitrum (L2) â†’ GMX ( gambling not trading xD )
- zkSync

Important factors:
- Cheap fees
- Infrastructure (swap/bridges/interoperability)
- Centralized/decentralized and manipulation resistance
- Tx speed (execution + finality)

It was cool to hear my teammates! We also did the Rust homework in parallel, check out the solution in the folder.
