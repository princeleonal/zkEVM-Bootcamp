## Notes on the podcast
Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs (zkSync)

Main takes:
- Boojum can make the PLONK's setup transparent
- It will also improve the effectiveness of proof computations
- Provers are hardware agnostic; you can use any hardware, any platform, with any software if it provides the same proof in the result
- Decentralized provers are a thing if you want to build a scalable system
- ZK Credo is a "manifesto that outlines the guiding properties and principles for the emerging ZK-powered Internet of Value"
- Alex mentioned Network States forking the open-source code of zk-rollups to enforce their own principles if they disagree with the original ones
- Hyperbridges allow you to move assets from between Hyperchains without L1 with zk-proofs
- Argentina (Buenos Aires) [released](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-releases-blockchain-digital-identity-solution-powered-by-matter-labs-zk-proofs/) decentralized digital identity powered by zkSync
- In the future, L1 won't be used for normal user transactions
- For blockchains to become mainstream in the world and fully substitute fiat, they have to be private
