1. S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
   1. 4 + 4 = 1
   2. 3 * 5 = 15 % 7 = 1
   3. Inverse of 3 under addition is 4 because `(3+4) % 7 = 0`, and multiplication is 5 because `(3*5) % 7 = 1`
2. Yes, S is a cyclic group
3. -13 mod 5 = -3
4. x^3 − x^2 + 4x − 12
   1. The positive root is 2
   2. It has the degree of 3
