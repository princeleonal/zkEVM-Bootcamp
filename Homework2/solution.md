## My notes
There are several reasons why client diversity is important:
- Larger pool of developers, because diversity allows people with different skills to support the ecosystem.
- Better security because Ethereum doesn't rely on a single language and implementation where hackers could find a zero-day vulnerability and bring down the entire network.
- Better system requirements because different environments can run different implementations of the client with different performance.

Importance of different concepts in my opinion (from most important to least):
1. Security
2. Decentralization
3. Finality
4. TPS and transaction costs
5. Privacy

Security over decentralization because crypto can't be insecure, otherwise it doesn't make sense to me. Finality over TPS, because there's no point in fast transactions if you still have to wait 100 blocks until you're sure the tx won't be undone.
Privacy is a concept that I very much desire, but modern crypto has proven that it is optional.
